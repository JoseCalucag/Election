## Project Overview

I was tasked by the Colorado Board of Elections committee to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. With the collected data, they wanted certain data points to be reported:

 1) Determine the total number of votes casted.
 2) Create a list of candidates who received votes.
 3) Determine the total number of votes each candidate received.
 4) Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
 5) Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
 6) Determine the number of votes that were casted from each county.
 7) Calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election.
 8) Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Audit Summary
  As long as future csv's have the same tabular format, we should be able to use the python code
